IntelTrace: Reasoning-Based Segmentation for Tactical Defence Surveillance using Multimodal LLMs

üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

In modern defence scenarios, the accurate identification of critical visual elements ‚Äì such as camouflaged threats, suspicious patterns, or hidden installations ‚Äì demands a contextual understanding that goes beyond simple, explicit labels. The IntelTrace project aims to address this challenge by developing a reasoning-based segmentation assistant leveraging advanced multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs).

This system will be capable of interpreting natural language defence queries and generating precise segmentation masks within complex, high-resolution imagery, including satellite and drone feeds. Our core objective is to enable zero-shot detection and segmentation of semantically intricate objects using implicit instructions, thereby significantly enhancing situational awareness and accelerating threat identification in real-time tactical environments.

‚ú® Features

Reasoning-Based Segmentation: Utilizes multimodal LLMs to understand complex natural language queries and apply reasoning for precise object segmentation.

Multimodal LLM Integration: Seamlessly combines visual and textual understanding for advanced analysis.

Zero-Shot Detection & Segmentation: Ability to identify and segment novel or previously unseen objects based on descriptive language, without requiring explicit prior training data for every object type.

High-Resolution Image Processing: Robust pre-processing and post-processing components designed to handle and extract insights from high-resolution defence imagery.

Real-Time Surveillance Capability: Integration with real-time surveillance feeds for instantaneous threat identification.

Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly interface for query submission and interactive visualization of segmentation results.


üöÄ Development Roadmap

This section outlines the key development tasks and their current status:

‚úÖ 1. Design the system architecture integrating multimodal LLM with a segmentation inference pipeline.

‚úÖ 2. Implement the reasoning-aware query parsing and context interpretation module.

‚úÖ 3. Develop the image pre-processing and mask post-processing components for high-resolution defence imagery.

‚úÖ 4. Integrate zero-shot inference capability with real-time surveillance feed handling.

‚úÖ 5. Build an intuitive user interface for submitting natural language queries and visualizing segmentation results.

‚úÖ 6. Conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation of system performance on benchmark scenarios.

üíª Usage 

Instructions on how to run the IntelTrace system and submit queries will be updated here. The general workflow will involve:

Starting the application.

Connecting to a surveillance feed (simulated or live).

Inputting natural language queries into the UI.

Reviewing the generated segmentation masks and threat identifications.
