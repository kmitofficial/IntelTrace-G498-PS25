IntelTrace: Reasoning-Based Segmentation for Tactical Defence Surveillance using Multimodal LLMs

🛡️ Project Overview

In modern defence scenarios, the accurate identification of critical visual elements – such as camouflaged threats, suspicious patterns, or hidden installations – demands a contextual understanding that goes beyond simple, explicit labels. The IntelTrace project aims to address this challenge by developing a reasoning-based segmentation assistant leveraging advanced multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs).

This system will be capable of interpreting natural language defence queries and generating precise segmentation masks within complex, high-resolution imagery, including satellite and drone feeds. Our core objective is to enable zero-shot detection and segmentation of semantically intricate objects using implicit instructions, thereby significantly enhancing situational awareness and accelerating threat identification in real-time tactical environments.

✨ Features

Reasoning-Based Segmentation: Utilizes multimodal LLMs to understand complex natural language queries and apply reasoning for precise object segmentation.

Multimodal LLM Integration: Seamlessly combines visual and textual understanding for advanced analysis.

Zero-Shot Detection & Segmentation: Ability to identify and segment novel or previously unseen objects based on descriptive language, without requiring explicit prior training data for every object type.

High-Resolution Image Processing: Robust pre-processing and post-processing components designed to handle and extract insights from high-resolution defence imagery.

Real-Time Surveillance Capability: Integration with real-time surveillance feeds for instantaneous threat identification.

Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly interface for query submission and interactive visualization of segmentation results.


🚀 Development Roadmap

This section outlines the key development tasks and their current status:

✅ 1. Design the system architecture integrating multimodal LLM with a segmentation inference pipeline.

✅ 2. Implement the reasoning-aware query parsing and context interpretation module.

✅ 3. Develop the image pre-processing and mask post-processing components for high-resolution defence imagery.

✅ 4. Integrate zero-shot inference capability with real-time surveillance feed handling.

✅ 5. Build an intuitive user interface for submitting natural language queries and visualizing segmentation results.

✅ 6. Conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation of system performance on benchmark scenarios.
